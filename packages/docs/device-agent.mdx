### About Comp AI Device Agent

Comp AI Device Agent is a lightweight desktop application that runs in your system tray and automatically monitors your device's security compliance. It checks your device configuration every hour and reports the results to your organization's Comp AI portal.

The agent checks four security areas:

| Security Check | What It Verifies |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Disk Encryption** | FileVault (macOS), BitLocker (Windows), or LUKS (Linux) is enabled |
| **Antivirus** | Active antivirus protection (XProtect, Windows Defender, ClamAV, etc.) |
| **Password Policy** | Minimum 8-character password enforced at the OS level |
| **Screen Lock** | Automatic screen lock activates within 5 minutes of inactivity |

Your device is **compliant** when all four checks pass.

<Note>
  The agent runs silently in your system tray and uses minimal system resources. It does not collect personal data, browsing history, or file contents.
</Note>

### System Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Operating Systems** | macOS 14+, Windows 10+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+) |
| **Memory** | 512MB RAM minimum |
| **Storage** | 200MB available disk space |

### Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Download the Agent" icon="download">
    Log in to your organization's [Employee Portal](https://portal.trycomp.ai) and navigate to the **Device Agent** task. Click **Download Agent** to get the installer for your operating system.

    - **macOS**: Downloads a `.dmg` file. If you have an Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4), the portal selects the correct version automatically. You can also switch between Apple Silicon and Intel using the dropdown.
    - **Windows**: Downloads a `.exe` installer.
    - **Linux**: Downloads a `.deb` package.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Install the Agent" icon="computer">
    **macOS**: Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag the Comp AI Device Agent to your Applications folder.

    **Windows**: Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard.

    **Linux**: Install the downloaded `.deb` package using your package manager or by double-clicking it:
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i CompAI-Device-Agent-amd64.deb
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Sign In" icon="user">
    After installation, the agent opens a sign-in window. Log in with your work email using the same method you use for the Employee Portal (email OTP, Google, or Microsoft).

      src="/images/device-agent-sign-in.png"
      alt="Device Agent Sign In"
      className="mx-auto"
      style={{ width: "50%" }}
    />

    Once signed in, the agent automatically:
    1. Registers your device with your organization(s)
    2. Runs the first compliance check immediately
    3. Starts checking every hour in the background
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Using the Device Agent

After signing in, the agent lives in your system tray (menu bar on macOS, system tray on Windows/Linux). Click the tray icon to open the status window.

<img
  src="/images/device-agent-status.png"
  alt="Device Agent Status Window"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width: "55%" }}
/>

The status window shows:
- **Compliance status** — whether your device is compliant or needs attention
- **Individual checks** — each of the four security checks with Pass/Fail status
- **Remediation options** — for any failing check, the agent offers a way to fix it

#### Tray Icon Status

| Icon Color | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Green** | Device is compliant — all checks passing |
| **Red** | Device is non-compliant — one or more checks failing |
| **Gray** | Agent is not signed in or checks are loading |

#### Fixing Failing Checks

When a check fails, the agent provides remediation options depending on what can be done automatically:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fix** | The agent fixes the issue automatically |
| **Fix (Admin)** | The agent fixes it but may prompt for your system password |
| **Open Settings** | Opens the relevant OS settings pane so you can fix it manually |
| **View Guide** | Shows step-by-step instructions to resolve the issue |

<Tip>
  After fixing a failing check, click **Run Checks Now** to verify the fix immediately instead of waiting for the next hourly check.
</Tip>

#### Tray Menu Options

Right-click (or click on macOS) the tray icon to access:
- **Run Checks Now** — trigger an immediate compliance check
- **View Details** — open the status window
- **Start at Login** — toggle whether the agent launches automatically when you log in (enabled by default)
- **Sign Out** — sign out of the agent
- **Quit** — close the agent completely

<Warning>
  If you quit or sign out of the agent, your device will stop reporting compliance status to your organization. Your security administrator may follow up if your device stops checking in.
</Warning>

### Verifying on the Portal

After the agent runs its first check, you can verify your device compliance status on the Employee Portal. The **Device Agent** task shows your device name, platform, and whether all security checks are passing.

The portal updates automatically — it polls your device status every 30 seconds while the page is open.

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent won't sign in">
    - Make sure you're using the same email address you use for the Employee Portal
    - Check your internet connection
    - Try quitting the agent completely and reopening it
    - If using Google or Microsoft sign-in, make sure popups are not blocked
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Checks are failing unexpectedly">
    - Click **Run Checks Now** to refresh the results
    - Review the failing check details — the agent shows what it detected
    - Use the remediation option provided (Fix, Open Settings, or View Guide)
    - Some changes (like enabling FileVault) require a restart to take effect
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent is not visible in the system tray">
    - **macOS**: Look in the menu bar at the top of your screen. The icon may be hidden — check the overflow area (click the `>>` or similar)
    - **Windows**: Click the up arrow in the system tray to see hidden icons
    - **Linux**: Check your desktop environment's system tray or notification area
    - The agent may need to be reopened from your Applications folder
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Portal shows device as non-compliant even though agent shows all checks passing">
    - Wait up to 30 seconds for the portal to refresh
    - Click **Run Checks Now** in the agent to trigger a fresh report
    - Check that the agent is signed in (tray icon should be green, not gray)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Migrating from FleetDM

If your device previously had the FleetDM agent (fleetd) installed, you should uninstall it after setting up the new Comp AI Device Agent. The new agent fully replaces FleetDM, and having both running is unnecessary.

Follow the official uninstall guide for your platform: [How to uninstall fleetd](https://fleetdm.com/guides/how-to-uninstall-fleetd)
